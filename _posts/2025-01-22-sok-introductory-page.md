<span style="font-size: 20px;">Season of KDE 2025 â€“ Bringing Pallanguli to Mankala Engine</span>

Hello everyone! Iâ€™m excited to be a part of Season of KDE 2025, continuing my contributions to the Mankala Engine by integrating the Pallanguli variant of Mancala.

Pallanguli is a fascinating two-player game with deep strategic elements and a rich cultural history in South India. Unlike many Mancala variants, it features long, cascading moves, intricate capture mechanics, and a dynamic board state that makes for highly engaging gameplay. Implementing Pallanguli within the Mankala Engine is both a technical and theoretical challengeâ€”one that Iâ€™m eager to take on!
Enhancing AI & Game Strategy

While integrating the gameâ€™s mechanics, Iâ€™m also focusing on improving AI strength and decision-making. The current engine uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, which is effective but may not fully capture the complexity of Pallanguliâ€™s branching game tree. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m exploring Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and other heuristic-driven approaches to see if they offer better performance.

Additionally, I plan to build an opening book for Pallanguli, similar to those used in chess engines. By precomputing strong opening sequences, the AI can make optimal early-game decisions, reducing the need for brute-force searching while maintaining strong play. This will not only make the AI more efficient but also provide a structured way for players to learn and understand strong opening moves.
The Road Ahead

Thereâ€™s a lot to do, from refining the move generation and evaluation functions to ensuring smooth integration with the existing engine. Iâ€™m also excited to collaborate with the KDE community, get feedback, and improve the engineâ€™s usability for both casual players and AI researchers interested in strategic games.

Looking forward to an exciting Season of KDE, learning more, and making Mankala Engine a better platform for exploring Mancala variants! ðŸš€
