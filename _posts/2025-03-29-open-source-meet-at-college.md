Sharing the Joy of Open Source: College Meet-Up Recap

Last week, I had the privilege of conducting an open source meet at my college, and it was an absolute blast! The event ran for about 2 to 2.5 hours, and it was fantastic to see so many curious faces eager to learn and explore the world of open source.

We kicked things off by introducing everyone to the MankalaEngine. I let the attendees try out the engine in its terminal user interface (TUI), and it was rewarding to see them engaged with the gameplay. Watching people strategize and appreciate the intricacies of Pallanguli on the engine was a highlight for me.

But the fun didn’t stop there. We also had a hands-on session with Linux distributions, where attendees got to explore Fedora, Nobara, and Linux Mint. For some, it was their first encounter with Linux, and we even managed to port a few of them over to these operating systems! Seeing their excitement as they discovered the possibilities with Linux was truly inspiring.

Of course, no event is complete without refreshments, and we made sure to keep everyone fueled. The mushroom puffs were a big hit—so good that they might’ve stolen the show for a moment!

Overall, it was an incredible experience to share my passion for open source and see others getting just as excited about it. Events like these remind me why I love this community so much.

Looking forward to hosting more such events in the future and spreading the open source love!
