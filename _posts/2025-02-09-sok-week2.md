# Season of KDE 2025 â€“ Progress Update on Pallanguli Integration  

Iâ€™ve made significant progress on integrating **Pallanguli** into the **Mankala Engine**. The core mechanics are now implemented, including **move generation, captures, and turn-based play**. The game follows the expected rules, and initial tests indicate that it functions correctly within the engine.  

## Current Focus  
- **Verifying Rule Implementation** â€“ Ensuring all edge cases are handled correctly.  
- **Performance Considerations** â€“ Optimizing move generation to handle long cascading moves efficiently.  
- **AI Adaptation** â€“ The existing **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** has been applied, but improvements may be needed to account for Pallanguliâ€™s unique characteristics.  

## Next Steps  
- **Alternative AI Strategies**  
  - Exploring **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to evaluate its effectiveness.  
- **Opening Book Development**  
  - Investigating precomputed strategies to improve AIâ€™s early-game play.  
- **Further Testing & Refinements**  
  - Running game simulations to validate AI behavior and optimize performance.  

This update marks a solid step forward, but thereâ€™s still work to do in refining the AI and optimizing performance. Looking forward to the next phase.
