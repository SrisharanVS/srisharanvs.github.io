Reflecting on My Journey with Season of KDE

As the Season of KDE comes to a close, I can’t help but feel a mix of pride and gratitude. This program has been a transformative experience, and I’m thrilled to share the highlights of what I’ve accomplished over these months.

The centerpiece of my project was integrating Pallanguli into the MankalaEngine. I’m happy to report that Pallanguli is now fully implemented and functional. This required refining the move logic, addressing various bugs. It was rewarding to see the game come together and offer a polished experience for players.

In addition to completing the integration, I took steps to make Pallanguli accessible to a wider audience. One of the key milestones was opening a request on Bugzilla Fedora to release the MankalaEngine as a Linux package. This step will make it easier for Linux users to install and enjoy the game, and I’m excited about the possibilities this will unlock.

Throughout the program, I stayed actively involved in the KDE community. I attended weekly calls, collaborated with mentors and contributors, and made sure to document my progress in a way that others can build upon. The support and guidance I received from the community were invaluable and made the entire experience even more enriching.

Looking back, this journey has taught me so much—not just about open-source development and game engines, but also about collaboration, problem-solving, and perseverance. I’m incredibly grateful to KDE for this opportunity and to everyone who supported me along the way.

What’s Next?

While the Season of KDE is ending, my journey with open source is far from over. I plan to keep contributing to KDE and exploring new ways to improve MankalaEngine. Additionally, I’m eager to see how Pallanguli evolves as more users engage with it and provide feedback.

I’m also excited to explore new opportunities, including participating in **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**. Building on my work with KDE, I aim to tackle more ambitious projects, dive deeper into open source, and continue growing as a developer.

Thank you to the KDE community, my mentors, **Benson Muite** and **João Gouveia**, and everyone who encouraged me throughout this program. Here’s to many more adventures in open source!
